Simple example program for SHA using OPENSSL library.
For the program, OPENSSL should be installed first in your local.
And you can make it using kind of "gcc -o main main.c sha.c -lcrypto" command.

@Information
    The SHA(Secure Hash Algorithm) is a family of cryptographic hash functions, firstly designed by NIST in 1993.
    The SHA-2 family is more recommended than SHA-1 due to SHA-1's vulnerabilities.
